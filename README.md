Customizing a Bootstrap SASS build with Bower
=============================================

This project demonstrates an example of customizing a Bootstrap SASS build.  This sample project uses Bower to install Bootstrap and Gulp to build the CSS with gulp-sass.


To install:

    $ npm install
    $ bower install


To build the CSS, run `gulp`:

    $ gulp

Once you have built the CSS, open `index.html` in your web browser to view the customized Bootstrap template.

To customize the build further, modify the variables in the `css/variables.scss` file.
